# HeavensArena
This is a 2D fighting game I created in highschool based on HunterxHunter. At the time I didn not really understand object oriented concepts and why they are important. I would certainly not call it my best work and would honestly be embarassed to make it now, but I am proud of how hard I worked on it and how far I've come since making it. I think it serves as a good reminder of how much I have learned and that even if I think I wrote the best thing ever, I'll probably cringe at it in two years.
